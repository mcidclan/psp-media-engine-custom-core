## PSP Media Engine Custom Core: POC

Poc demonstrating the use of meCoreDcacheWritebackInvalidateAll and meCoreBusClockFilterEnabled.

## Usage
Build it with CMake, then copy the EBOOT.PBP and kcall.prx (available in the /build folder) into the same folder within the GAME directory.  

Note: The provided `main.cpp` is experimental and serves as an entry point for manual testing and exploration, allowing functions to be called and their behavior observed to determine how they can be integrated into homebrew projects.
